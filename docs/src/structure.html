<h1> Structure </h1>

<h2> Object Hierarchy </h2>

<p>
  The core object in <i>presto</i> is the <span class=code>Trajectory</span>, which represents a single trajectory.
  Each trajectory contains a number of <span class=code>Frame</span> objects, which represent snapshots of atomic positions, velocities, and accelerations.
  Frames can be converted into <span class=code>cctk.Molecule</span> objects by calling <span class=code>frame.molecule()</span>.
</p>

<p>
  Each trajectory is associated with a given <span class=code>Calculator</span> and <span class=code>Integrator</span>,
  which together dictate how new frames are generated. 
  More specifically, the calculator calls an external program to compute the forces, 
  and the integrator generates the next frame by applying the forces to the current frame.
</p>

<p>
  Every trajectory has a <span class=code>.chk</span> checkpoint file, which represents a saved snapshot of the trajectory.
  The checkpoint file is stored in the compressed <span class=code>hdf5</span> format and is not human-readable.
  Frames are added to the checkpoint file every <span class=code>trajectory.checkpoint_interval</span> frames.
</p>

<p>
  Although trajectories can be initiated from pure Python code, the simplest and safest way to start a trajectory with the desired settings is
  by using a config <span class=code>.yaml</span> file, which builds the desired Python objects automatically:
</p>

<pre class=code-block>
  &gt; trajectory = presto.build("config.yaml", "save.chk")
  &gt; print(trajectory)
  Trajectory(243 frames)
</pre>

<p>
  Trajectories also possess <span class=code>Check</span> and <span class=code>Reporter</span> objects. 
  Check objects periodically perform "sanity checks" on the trajectory,
  while reporter objects extract data and write it to an external file.
</p>

<h2> What Happens When A Trajectory Is Run? </h2>

<p>
  When a trajectory is run (using <span class=code>trajectory.run()</span>), a complex sequence of events occurs:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The trajectory spawns a <span class=code>Controller</span> object, which manages running new frames.
  </li>
  <li>
    The controller determines the new forces using the trajectory's <span class=code>Calculator</span> (<span class=code>trajectory.calculator</span>).
    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
      <li>
        The calculator dispatches force jobs to Gaussian or <i>xtb</i> and parses the output. (This is usually the rate-determining step.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, the calculator applies whatever constraints the user has defined, to freeze certain bonds or prevent atoms from leaving the sphere.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <span class=code>Integrator</span> (<span class=code>trajectory.integrator</span>) then calculates new coordinates based on the previous frame,
    writes a new frame, and appends it to <span class=code>trajectory.frames</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The controller checks if the new frame satisfies the termination conditions or if the timelimit has been exceeded.
    If not, the cycle repeats!
  </li>
</ol>
