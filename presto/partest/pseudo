constraints: traj needs to be buit from a yaml, need to write one yaml per t

for each cycle:
    set up trajectories

   for each traj:
      read setup info
      run as separate job (run.py has master script that takes temp as param)
      dump frame with attrs into chk file

   exchange script starts (slurm controls dependency):
      for each traj, loads frame info from chk
      compares energies and
