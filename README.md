## Introduction

*presto* is a Python 3-based package that runs QM/QM' molecular dynamics simulations of small organic molecules in spheres of explicit solvent (50-250 solvent molecules). *presto* is loosely based on Singletonâ€™s *PROGDYN*, as described in recent publications on the [nitration of toluene](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b07328) and [hydrochlorination of dienes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.0c06295). 

For more details, see [the website](https://corinwagen.github.io/presto/public/index.html).

**IMPORTANT:**
*presto* is currently in "alpha": testing is ongoing and no guarantees as to correctness or API consistency can be made at this time. 
As of Summer 2021 the package works, but bugs are certainly present in a project of this size.
If you are interesting in using *presto* or contributing as a developer, please let me know!
